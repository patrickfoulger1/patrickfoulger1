👋 Hey, I’m Patrick, a Software Engineer and Board Game Designer

🎲 I develop mods for TTS, creating and designing digital prototypes of boardgames for board game developers 🎲
🖥️ I'm working on my full stack web development skills at the moment working full time in a fulltime bootcamp 🖥️

You may see me working with a variety of technologies

![Stack](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,nodejs,postgres,lua,python,npm,c#)

## Steam Workshop  
My [public mods](https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSuperjolly/myworkshopfiles/?p=1) can be found, on the steam workshop but you'd need to subscribe install tabletop simulator to interact with them

## other projects  
You can see a demonstration of my coding skills on some public projects I keep on my github
