## Welcome  
👋 Hey, I’m Patrick, a Software Engineer and Board Game Designer  
🎲 I develop mods for TTS, creating and designing digital prototypes of boardgames for board game developers 🎲  
🖥️ I'm working on my full stack web development skills at the moment working full time in a fulltime bootcamp 🖥️  

You may see me working with a variety of technologies

## Steam Workshop  
My [public mods](https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSuperjolly/myworkshopfiles/?p=1) can be found, on the steam workshop but you'd need to subscribe install tabletop simulator to interact with them
A couple of my clients I've helped design and script mods for their games include
- https://oathtoembers.com/
- https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tokenterrors/token-terrors-battlegrounds
- https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mantisfalls/mantis-falls-a-game-of-trust

Every project I've made in tabletop simulator required a strong fundamental understanding of Lua, and Object Oriented Programming. I also had to make UI, UX decisions for a lot of my projects and work closely with my clients to develop the experience they wanted to recreate.


## Other Projects  
You can see a demonstration of my coding skills on some public projects I keep on my github  
 - [NC News](https://github.com/patrickfoulger1/nc_news) A RESTful api built from the ground up that interacts with a psql database stroing users, articles and comments hosted ready to be a backend for a future news site
 - [News Spin](https://github.com/patrickfoulger1/nc_news_frontend) A React Router + Tailwind app built as a front end for my NC News database and api that lets users explore through different articles, and leave likes and comments.
